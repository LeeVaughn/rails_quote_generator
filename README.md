# Random Quote Generator (Work in Progress)

This Rails application randomly selects a programming, learning, or success related quote from a database and displays it on the screen.

## Motivation

Loosely based on the first project in the FSJS Techdegree, I build this application to further develop my Ruby and Ruby on Rails skills.

## Features

* A random quote is displayed upon page load
* After 10 seconds the app will automatically display a new quote
* The user can click the "Show another quote" button to generate a new quote

## Future Improvements

* Prevent repeat quotes
* Each time a new quote is displayed the background and button color will be randomly chosen

## To Run

* Coming soon...
